1. WeatherDisplay Component:
Responsibility: Display weather information for the selected city.
Props:
city: Name of the city for which weather information is displayed.
temperature: Temperature of the selected city.
description: Brief description of the weather in the selected city.
Behavior:
Uses React Native's Text component to display city name, temperature, and weather description.
Applies basic styling using StyleSheet.create to format the displayed data.
2. CitySelector Component:
Responsibility: Allows the user to select a city from a predefined list.
Props:
cities: An array containing the names of available cities.
onCitySelect: A callback function to handle city selection.
Behavior:
Renders a Picker component to display a dropdown of available cities.
When the user selects a city, it triggers the handleCityChange function, updating the selected city state and invoking the onCitySelect callback with the selected city.
3. App Component:
Responsibility: Acts as the main component that integrates WeatherDisplay and CitySelector.
State:
selectedWeather: Holds the weather information for the currently selected city.
Behavior:
Imports WeatherDisplay, CitySelector, and the weatherData object (mock weather information).
Initializes the cities array by extracting city names from the weatherData object keys.
Provides the handleCitySelect function, which updates the selectedWeather state based on the selected city.
Renders a View container that houses CitySelector and WeatherDisplay components.
Passes necessary props to CitySelector and WeatherDisplay, including the list of cities and weather information for the default city (first city in the list).
Overall Flow:
Initialization:

The App component initializes the state, sets up available cities, and displays the initial weather information for the default city.
Rendering Components:

Renders the CitySelector component, providing it with the list of cities and a callback function to handle city selection.
Renders the WeatherDisplay component, passing weather information for the initially selected city.
User Interaction:

Upon selecting a city in the CitySelector, it triggers a state update through the callback function (handleCitySelect) in the App.
This state update triggers a re-render, updating the WeatherDisplay component with the weather information for the newly selected city.
Display Update:

As the state changes (due to city selection), the WeatherDisplay component receives updated props, reflecting the selected city's weather details.
